# Oscillations

A repository for the Pure Data patch of the audiovisual installation Oscillations: a performance ecosystem that turns irons and ironing boards into electronic instruments. The Artwork has been developed by Patty Preece, Melania Jack & Giacomo Lepri. 
The Pd patch used in the instruments is an adaptation of Yann Seznec's Granular Sampler - https://github.com/yannseznec/Granular-Sampler-MICA
